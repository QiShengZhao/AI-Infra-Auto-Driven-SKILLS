This repository is built for AI infrastructure engineers who want agents to do
real work, not recite generic prompts.

It gives an agent the operational memory needed to benchmark SGLang, vLLM, and
TensorRT-LLM fairly; explain serving capacity from startup logs; split prefill
and decode profiler evidence; inspect traces at layer and kernel level; estimate
operator FLOPs and MFU; review SGLang patches against real maintainer discussion
patterns; run Humanize-governed SGLang and vLLM SOTA loops; triage SGLang
production incidents from a replay; and keep model-family optimization history
close to the code that actually changed.

For standalone kernel campaigns and kernel evidence tools, see the sibling
project **[KernelPilot](https://github.com/BBuf/kernel-pilot)**.

If this saves you one stale model-support assumption, one misleading profiler
trace, or one late-night benchmark loop, a star helps more AI-infra engineers
find it.

## Core Skills

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| [`llm-serving-auto-benchmark`](skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark/) | You need a fair, bounded serving benchmark search for SGLang, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or another OpenAI-compatible stack. |
| [`llm-serving-capacity-planner`](skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner/) | You need to explain SGLang or vLLM startup memory, KV cache budget, request capacity, or OOM pressure from logs. |
| [`llm-torch-profiler-analysis`](skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis/) | You need a three-table profiler report that keeps `extend/prefill` and `decode` evidence separate. |
| [`llm-pipeline-analysis`](skills/llm-pipeline-analysis/) | You need forward-pass, layer, and kernel-level timing from a torch profiler trace, including anchor boundaries and Perfetto ranges. |
| [`model-compute-simulation`](skills/model-compute-simulation/) | You need operator shapes, FLOPs, MFU estimates, kernel-to-op mapping, or parallelism what-if analysis for an LLM serving shape. |
| [`sglang-humanize-review`](skills/sglang-humanize-review/) | You need SGLang code-review findings grounded in 2024-2025 human review threads, including inline code context, comments, and discussions. |
| [`sglang-sota-humanize-loop`](skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop/) | You want one model-level Humanize RLCR loop that owns gap decisions, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep dives, SGLang patches, optional `ncu-report-skill` evidence, and real-model revalidation after the fixed fair benchmark. |
| [`vllm-sota-humanize-loop`](skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop/) | You want one model-level Humanize RLCR loop that owns gap decisions, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep dives, vLLM patches, optional `ncu-report-skill` evidence, and real-model revalidation after the fixed fair benchmark. |
| [`sglang-prod-incident-triage`](skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage/) | You need to turn queue growth, timeouts, wrong outputs, crashes, or distributed stalls into a replay and next debug step. |
| [`model-architecture-diagram`](skills/model-architecture-diagram/) | You need original public architecture diagrams for popular LLM, VLM, MoE, OCR, and diffusion model families. |

## Model PR History Catalog

The model optimization layer is now one knowledge base:
[`model-pr-optimization-history`](model-pr-optimization-history/). It contains
58 PR-driven history dossiers and a small query helper. These are not
per-model runbook skills; they preserve diff-backed model evolution records for
SGLang and vLLM so SOTA loops can read prior source and PR evidence before
patching.

| Framework | PR histories |
| --- | ---: |
| [SGLang](model-pr-optimization-history/sglang/) | 29 |
| [vLLM](model-pr-optimization-history/vllm/) | 29 |

Covered families include:

```text
DeepSeek V3/R1/V3.1/V3.2/V4, Qwen3, Qwen3-Coder, Qwen3-Next,
Qwen3.5/Qwen3.6, Qwen VLM/Omni/ASR, GLM 4.5/4.6/4.7/5,
Kimi, MiniMax, Llama 4, Mistral Small 4, Mixtral, Nemotron,
Gemma, Ernie 4.5, Intern-S1, InternVL, Hunyuan, MOSS-VL,
GPT-OSS, Step 3.5, Mimo, and model-specific MoE/quantization paths.
```

Each model-family history is designed to answer practical questions:

- Which PRs changed this model path?
- Was the PR merged, closed, or still open?
- Which files and symbols moved?
- What optimization or correctness risk should be checked before touching it?
- Which upstream idea should be compared before writing a new kernel or fusion?

Query examples:

```bash
cd model-pr-optimization-history
python3 scripts/query.py --list
python3 scripts/query.py --framework sglang --model qwen3-core --paths-only
python3 scripts/query.py --framework vllm "qwen3 fused qk norm"
```

## Evidence Standards

The repo is opinionated about evidence because performance work gets noisy fast.

- Benchmark rows should include model, framework, GPU count, workload, request
  rate or concurrency, SLA status, launch command, benchmark command, and raw
  artifacts.
- Profiler reports should keep prefill and decode separate, then emit the same
  three tables: kernel table, overlap-opportunity table, and fuse-opportunity
  table.
- SOTA claims should be scoped to the exact model, hardware, framework commits,
  precision, workload, and SLA used in the run.
- Humanize SOTA loops should keep only the fixed fair benchmark outside the
  patch loop; gap decisions, profiler triage, required layer-pipeline deep
  dives, kernel evidence, target-framework code changes, and revalidation all
  stay inside one model-level RLCR loop.
- Kernel-local fixes inside that loop should use `ncu-report-skill` when Nsight
  Compute counter evidence is needed, store NCU digests, and still pass the
  same real-model benchmark/profile gate.
- Incident triage should start from replayable evidence instead of changing code
  from symptoms alone.
- Model optimization histories should point back to PRs, files, diffs, and risk
  surfaces rather than vague summary text; they live as one PR-driven knowledge
  base, not per-model skills.

## Install

This repository is not Codex-only. The skills are plain `SKILL.md` directories
and can be installed into Claude Code, Codex, Kimi, or another compatible agent
runtime.

### Claude Code (one-shot plugin install)

The repository ships a `.claude-plugin/` manifest so the whole skill set can be
installed as a single Claude Code plugin via the built-in marketplace flow:

```text
/plugin marketplace add BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS
/plugin install ai-infra-auto-driven-skills@ai-infra-auto-driven-skills
/reload-plugins
```

After reload, the 11 skills appear namespaced as
`ai-infra-auto-driven-skills:<skill-name>` (for example
`ai-infra-auto-driven-skills:sglang-sota-humanize-loop`). Update later with
`/plugin marketplace update ai-infra-auto-driven-skills`.

### Claude Code (per-skill symlink, legacy)

Prefer this when you only want a subset of the skills, or when developing
against a local checkout. Symlink is recommended for local development because
updates to this checkout are picked up immediately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BBuf/AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS.git
cd AI-Infra-Auto-Driven-SKILLS

mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark" ~/.claude/skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner" ~/.claude/skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis" ~/.claude/skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis
ln -s "$PWD/skills/llm-pipeline-analysis" ~/.claude/skills/llm-pipeline-analysis
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-compute-simulation" ~/.claude/skills/model-compute-simulation
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-humanize-review" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-humanize-review
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop
ln -s "$PWD/skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop" ~/.claude/skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop
ln -s "$PWD/skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage" ~/.claude/skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage
ln -s "$PWD/skills/model-architecture-diagram" ~/.claude/skills/model-architecture-diagram
ln -s "$PWD/model-pr-optimization-history" ~/.claude/skills/model-pr-history-knowledge
```

Restart Claude Code after installing. The skills can then be invoked by name,
for example `[$llm-serving-auto-benchmark]`,
`[$llm-serving-capacity-planner]`, `[$llm-torch-profiler-analysis]`,
`[$llm-pipeline-analysis]`, `[$model-compute-simulation]`,
`[$sglang-humanize-review]`, `[$sglang-sota-humanize-loop]`, or
`[$vllm-sota-humanize-loop]`.

If you prefer copies instead of symlinks, replace `ln -s` with `cp -R`. Copy
`model-pr-optimization-history` only when you want the agent to query the
PR-driven model knowledge base locally. It replaces the old per-model runbook
skill layout with one shared knowledge root.

### Generic Agent Skill Directory

For Codex, Kimi, or another compatible runtime, copy or symlink the same
directories into that runtime's skill directory:

```bash
cp -R skills/llm-serving-auto-benchmark <agent-skill-dir>/llm-serving-auto-benchmark
cp -R skills/llm-serving-capacity-planner <agent-skill-dir>/llm-serving-capacity-planner
cp -R skills/llm-torch-profiler-analysis <agent-skill-dir>/llm-torch-profiler-analysis
cp -R skills/llm-pipeline-analysis <agent-skill-dir>/llm-pipeline-analysis
cp -R skills/model-compute-simulation <agent-skill-dir>/model-compute-simulation
cp -R skills/sglang-humanize-review <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-humanize-review
cp -R skills/sglang-sota-humanize-loop <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-sota-humanize-loop
cp -R skills/vllm-sota-humanize-loop <agent-skill-dir>/vllm-sota-humanize-loop
cp -R skills/sglang-prod-incident-triage <agent-skill-dir>/sglang-prod-incident-triage
cp -R skills/model-architecture-diagram <agent-skill-dir>/model-architecture-diagram
cp -R model-pr-optimization-history <agent-skill-dir>/model-pr-history-knowledge
```
