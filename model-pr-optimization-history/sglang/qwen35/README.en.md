## Gap-Closure Notes

- Acceptance rule: every PR card must keep trace source, diff scope, implementation notes, code excerpts, reviewed files, and verification risk.
- If new model files fall outside the current filters, add the file filter first and rerun the same `git log --name-only -- <model-files>` trace.
