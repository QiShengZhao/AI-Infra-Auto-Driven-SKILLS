| PR | Model / area | Status | Current signal | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#29390](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/29390) | LTX-2.3 diffusion | merged | fused Ada values | Adds a Triton `ltx2_ada_values9` path that removes repeated Ada table materialization; profiler loops should classify split Ada add/reshape/slice ladders as a missing shipped fusion. |
| [#29250](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/29250) | MiniMax / MSA | merged | optional `fmha_sm100` fallback | Converts missing/incompatible MSA plan API into Triton sparse-attention fallback; benchmark comparisons should not count an image with broken optional MSA as a model-level SGLang regression without this fix. |
| [#23882](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23882) | DeepSeek-V4 | merged | rebase tracking | Keeps DSV4 branch integration moving; check before assuming local DeepSeek-V4 support is final. |
| [#24047](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24047) | DeepSeek-V4 / SM120 | closed | Blackwell-lite support | Affects FP4, MoE, and attention kernel eligibility on SM120 hardware. |
| [#18612](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/18612) | NVFP4 CUTLASS MoE | open | fused SiLU+Mul into expert quant | Covers a concrete activation-plus-quant MoE fuse opportunity. |
| [#22918](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22918) | NVFP4 MoE | merged | FlashInfer per-token NVFP4 MoE | May replace standalone per-token quant/dequant support kernels. |
| [#22851](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/22851) | NSA | merged | top-k backend selection | Affects whether NSA top-k is fused, FlashInfer-backed, or PyTorch fallback. |
| [#24125](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24125) | GLM-5 / NSA | merged | skip redundant TileLang decode cat/copy | Directly relevant when decode traces show `CatArrayBatchedCopy` or copy bursts. |
| [#24007](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24007) | MoE LoRA | merged | csgmv backend with virtual experts | Batches adapter work that otherwise appears as many small MoE-LoRA kernels. |
| [#24150](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24150) | torch.compile / decode | open | local compilation support | Can hide or replace handwritten decode fusions with Inductor-generated kernels. |
| [#21878](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/21878) | TTFT / TPOT | open | torch.compile-oriented latency work | Check before proposing one-off fixes for many small compiler-visible decode ops. |
| [#23965](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/23965) | DSV32 / GLM5 | merged | PDL for selected kernels | Changes launch-overlap interpretation around dependent decode kernels. |
| [#24168](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/pull/24168) | logprobs / embeddings | open | batched GPU-to-CPU sync | Relevant when profiler gaps point to per-request sync rather than GPU kernels. |
