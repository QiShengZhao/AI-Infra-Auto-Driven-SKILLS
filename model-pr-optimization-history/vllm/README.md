## Current Watch / Landed Items

Refresh: `2026-06-26`. Source head:
`vllm-project/vllm@abc71548ef029132c3316b902207f254a246d593`.

Keep watch rows close to the relevant model histories;
landed rows that are already mirrored in per-model docs remain here as
cross-model navigation hints.

| PR | Model / area | Status | Current signal | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [#44800](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/44800) | runtime sync debug | merged | `VLLM_GPU_SYNC_CHECK` env var | Helps distinguish real GPU gaps from accidental synchronization in profiler traces; SOTA loop should check whether a target image has this knob before comparing sync-heavy rows. |
| [#46735](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/46735) | Triton / NVFP4 MoE | merged | CUDA graph capture fix | A stale vLLM image can fail graph capture or fall back around Triton MoE; record this before treating the row as a true SGLang-vs-vLLM performance delta. |
| [#41455](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41455) | ROCm attention | closed | WMMA paged prefill and split-K decode | New AMD attention kernel family for prefill/decode split traces. |
| [#41263](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41263) | DeepSeek-V4 | merged | fuse norm/router low latency | Mirrored in `vllm/deepseek-v4`; concrete DSV4 norm-router fusion precedent. |
| [#41428](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41428) | DeepSeek-V4 | merged | fused indexer Q quant | Mirrored in `vllm/deepseek-v4`; relevant to FP4 indexer-Q quant ladders. |
| [#41255](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41255) | DeepSeek-V4 | merged | Tile kernels and `head_compute_mix_kernel` | Mirrored in `vllm/deepseek-v4`; specialized MLA/head-compute kernel work. |
| [#41441](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41441) | DeepSeek-V4 | closed | all-reduce plus `mhc_post` fusion | Affects collective-plus-postprocess overlap reads. |
| [#37646](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/37646) | ROCm TP | merged | AITER fused allreduce plus RMSNorm | AMD counterpart to FlashInfer allreduce fusion. |
| [#39748](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/39748) | Qwen3 / Qwen3.5 GDN | closed | dual-stream input projection | Precedent for overlapping linear-attention projection branches. |
| [#41446](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41446) | GatedDeltaNet / FLA | open | AMD prefill kernels | Relevant for Qwen3-Next-style linear-attention prefill bottlenecks. |
| [#41375](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41375) | sampler | merged | warm up `forward_native` sampler kernel | Avoids first-hit sampler artifacts in profiler and benchmark comparisons. |
| [#36823](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/36823) | vLLM IR | merged | `fused_add_rms_norm` overload visibility | Can determine whether downstream norm-plus-quant compile fusions match. |
| [#41433](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41433) / [#41434](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41434) / [#41429](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/41429) / [#40561](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/40561) | runtime sync | mixed: 3 merged / 1 closed | GPU/CPU sync removal and checks | Profiler gaps may be sync-removal work, not kernel fusion work. |
