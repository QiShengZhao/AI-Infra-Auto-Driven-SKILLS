The per-PR diff audit cards on this page were generated from TensorRT-LLM
upstream `HEAD@4164b932c6c8a14d1be85d0fd62e44b7d0171980`. The root
TensorRT-LLM history index tracks the latest 2026-06-26 runtime refresh at
`0722c5f47d2cae69ac1a237da51e550dd214532c`. This page provides model
implementation coverage, a timeline, and per-PR diff audit cards for Kimi K2
Thinking / Kimi K2.5.

Filter used in this pass: merged PRs whose titles or files matched `Kimi`, `kimi_k25`, `KimiK25`, `K2.5`, `K2 Thinking`, `NVFP4`, `multimodal`, `tool_parser`, `reasoning_parser`, `guided decoding`, `spec dec`, `rejection sampling`, or `NIXL`.

- Code excerpt:

```diff
+trtllm-serve nvidia/Kimi-K2-Thinking-NVFP4 \
+--extra_llm_api_options
```

- Validation/risk: record Blackwell/GB200 and disaggregation assumptions when using this as competitor evidence.

### PR #9830 - Support tool parser for Kimi K2

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/9830
- State/time: merged / 2025-12-12
- Diff coverage: 5 files, +374/-1, 528 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: Kimi K2 OpenAI-compatible serving needs correct tool-call parsing for agentic workloads.
- Key implementation: adds a Kimi K2 tool parser and wires it into the OpenAI server postprocess and parser factory.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+from .kimi_k2_tool_parser import KimiK2ToolParser
+class KimiK2ToolParser(BaseToolParser):
+        "kimi_k2": KimiK2ToolParser,
```

- Reviewed files: OpenAI server, postprocess handlers, `kimi_k2_tool_parser.py`, factory, tests
- Validation/risk: agentic correctness includes parser behavior, not just speed.

- State/time: merged / 2026-03-04
- Diff coverage: 2 files, +96/-0, 532 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: support Kimi-K2.5 text NVFP4 in the PyTorch backend.
- Key implementation: adapts the DeepSeekV3-style runtime and adds accuracy refs/tests.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+MODEL_NAME = "moonshotai/Kimi-K2.5"
+quant_algo: NVFP4
```

- Reviewed files: `modeling_deepseekv3.py`, accuracy refs/tests
- Validation/risk: separate text-only Kimi K2.5 from multimodal Kimi paths.

- Code excerpt:

```diff
+model_factory: KimiK2ForCausalLM
+flashinfer_mla
```

- Reviewed files: agent scaffold, `kimi_k2.yaml`, MLA ops, `modeling_kimi_k2.py`, AD tests
- Validation/risk: competitor path may be AutoDeploy rather than the plain PyTorch wrapper.

### PR #13801 - Add reasoning parser for Kimi-K2.5 and enable auto flow

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/13801
- State/time: merged / 2026-05-11
- Diff coverage: 2 files, +5/-1, 47 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: auto-select the right reasoning parser for Kimi-K2.5 thinking outputs.
- Key implementation: adds `kimi_k2/kimi_k25` auto-detect hints and registers `kimi_k25` with `reasoning_at_start=True`.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+"kimi_k25": "kimi_k25",
+@register_reasoning_parser("kimi_k25", reasoning_at_start=True)
```

- Reviewed files: `commands/serve.py`, `reasoning_parser.py`
- Validation/risk: parser selection affects eval scores.

### PR #12788 - Add Kimi K2.5 multimodal vision support

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/12788
- State/time: merged / 2026-05-14
- Diff coverage: 12 files, +2912/-64, 3,536 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: enable text/image/video Kimi K2.5 multimodal serving.
- Key implementation: adds `KimiK25ForConditionalGeneration`, vision model, input processor, placeholders, multimodal eval, and tests.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+@register_auto_model("KimiK25ForConditionalGeneration")
+class KimiK25ForConditionalGeneration(PreTrainedModel):
+    "video_placeholder": "<|kimi_k25_video_placeholder|>",
```

- Reviewed files: `modeling_kimi_k25.py`, `modeling_deepseekv3.py`, eval wrappers, multimodal tests
- Validation/risk: profile vision encoder, placeholder expansion, hashing fallback, and text decode as separate stages.

### PR #14379 - Fix Kimi_k25 with spec dec

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/14379
- State/time: merged / 2026-05-22
- Diff coverage: 1 file, +53/-35, 187 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: speculative decoding missed Kimi K2.5 multimodal params and `lm_head` delegation.
- Key implementation: threads `multimodal_params` through `forward` and adds an `lm_head` proxy.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+multimodal_params: Optional[List[MultimodalParams]] = None
+def lm_head(self): return self.llm.lm_head
```

- Reviewed files: `modeling_kimi_k25.py`
- Validation/risk: spec-dec comparisons need to verify context-only multimodal handling.

### PR #15233 - Fix embedding vocab mask for rejection sampling in Kimi-K2.5

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15233
- State/time: merged / 2026-06-17
- Diff coverage: 1 file, +15/-8, 129 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: FlashInfer rejection sampling can pad rejected tokens with non-vocab values.
- Key implementation: masks/clamps input before `F.embedding` in `pre_comm_embedding_ops`.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+# flashinfer's rejection kernel pads non-accepted tokens
+        input_, input_mask = get_masked_input_and_mask(
+            input_,
+            0,
+            weight.shape[0],
+        )
```

- Reviewed files: `embedding.py`
- Validation/risk: correctness risk sits in embedding preprocessing, not a visible hot kernel.

### PR #15443 - Un-waive K2.5 Thinking FP4 disagg-NIXL tests

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15443
- State/time: merged / 2026-06-23
- Diff coverage: 2 files, +2/-3, 86 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: Kimi K2.5 Thinking FP4 disaggregated NIXL lanes became stable enough to un-waive.
- Key implementation: removes Kimi NIXL skips and raises KV transfer timeout in perf-sanity YAML.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+kv_transfer_timeout_ms: 600000
```

- Reviewed files: `waives.txt`, Kimi NIXL perf-sanity YAML
- Validation/risk: disaggregated NIXL is a separate benchmark bucket.

### PR #15180 - Add necessary methods for guided decoding in Kimi K2.5

- Link: https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/pull/15180
- State/time: merged / 2026-06-25
- Diff coverage: 1 file, +3/-0, 28 cached patch lines.
- Motivation: Kimi K2.5 wrapper missed guided decoding delegation methods.
- Key implementation: proxies `set_guided_decoder` to the inner LLM.
- Code excerpt:

```diff
+def set_guided_decoder(self, *args, **kwargs):
+    return self.llm.set_guided_decoder(*args, **kwargs)
```

- Reviewed files: `modeling_kimi_k25.py`
- Validation/risk: guided decoding changes decode control flow; record whether it is enabled.
